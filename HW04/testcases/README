## K-Means Problem Test cases for grading

To run the test case, use the following approach:

1. copy all the required code file(all .c and .h files) except Makefile
2. the expected files are in `expected` folder
3. run `make` to make your binary for running
4. `make test(x)` will run `x` test case
5. output from your code will be save in `output(x).txt`
